Terraform state
- like when we used Terraform apply to create or update a resource,
we get a "terraform.tfstate" file that contains the state of the resource
it can acts as under lying database for Terraform resource
- it should be stored in a safe place, remote storage is recommended

-- Clean up ----------------
- terraform destroy
- terraform destroy --auto-approve
- terraform destroy -target aws_instance.example ,if we want to remove only one resource


----- next session -------
- key
- count
- data source , to get the ami id
- variable for paramertization
- outputs
- depends_on
-
